The crescent is a shape made from two points connected via circular arcs. This makes the shape very easy to draw using SVG
because the path function contains a special command called `A` which is specifically designed for drawing arcs.

	<path d="M100,100A133,133,0 1,1 100,300A114,114,0 1,0 100,100" fill="none" stroke="#333" stroke-width="2" />

The virtual pen is first moved to it's starting position using the command `M100,100`.
The syntax to draw an arc is as follows: `A133,133,0 1,1 100,300`.

* `A133,133` means the ellipse will have an x-radius and y-radius of 133. If they are equal, the arc will be circular.
* The next number (in the above case `0`) refers to how much the ellipse as a whole is rotated relative to the current
coordinate system.
* The next two numbers, `1,1` are flags which refer to the `large-arc-flag` and `sweep-flag` values. (See below for illustration).
* The last two numbers, `100,300` are the coordinates of the point to which the arc will be drawn.

In the diagram above, `height` is the vertical distance between the two points from which the arcs originate. The radii of the
two arcs are determined by `radius1` and `radius2`, and `largeArc2` allows you to toggle the `large-arc-flag` value for the second arc.
Both arcs have the `sweep-flag` fixed to 1, though you can of course change this in Codepen.

This image, from [w3.org](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathDataEllipticalArcCommands) illustrates how the sweep and arc flags
affect the appearance the arcs.
